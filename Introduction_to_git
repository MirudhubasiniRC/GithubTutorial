I have Started to learn some of the cool git commands in MAC

-- I checked whether i have my git installed in my folder :
 git --version in my terminal if not install it using brew install git

-- I you have many git hub accounts configure which one you want to use :
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

-- Navigate to your project folder 
    cd /path/to/your/project
    I used cd /documents/Git Tutorial


--> First command git init
you could be able to see something like this
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /Users/xxx/Documents/GitTutorial/.git/

--> git add .
to add in your local repo(inside your machine)

--> git commit -m "Initial commit"
to save changes 

xxx@xxxx-MacBook-Air GitTutorial % git commit -m "Initial changes"
[master (root-commit) 65d7a01] Initial changes
 1 file changed, 17 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 Introduction_to_git

TO ADD THE REMOTE REPOSITORY : IN YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT

create a repository in your account and then follow the below steps :

--> copy the url after creating the repository

--> git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

--> git push -u origin master

Problems i faced i did not get permission as i had two accounts something got mismatched

try cloning any one of the file from your account : 

create a folder 
cd created- folder name:
